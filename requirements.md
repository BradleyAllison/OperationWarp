Overall Goal of the Game:

To be able to travel the galaxy and buy and sell goods and services.

Starting Point:

Early level ship
Small amount of money (credits)
Start on Earth (Coord: (0,0))
Need to be able to buy and sell products
Game needs to have a compelling story with a beginning/middle/end

Planets and locations:

Need at least 2 additional planets
The first is called Alpha Proxima (Coord: (0,-4.246))
The rest are random at different locations in the galaxy
Need to have at least one random location for event or trading post
Use pythagorean therom to calculate distance between planets (in lightyears)
Each planet has a trading post with goods/services
Each planet will have a special/unique item that it sells at a higher price
Selling another planets special item on a different planet yields greater profit

Spaceship: 

Has a limitied storage capacity for goods
Has a system for fuel consumption which is why distance and speed are important
Speed is going to be in warp units using the star trek equation up till warp 9
  to convert that into lightyears/year
